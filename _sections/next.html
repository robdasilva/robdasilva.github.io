  <h2>Looking forward to</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      coding JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and everything else remotely at Basecamp all
      day long,
    </li>
    <li>
      creating aesthetic and joyful user interfaces taking advantage of my
      passion for development just as much as design,
    </li>
    <li>
      building and evolving Basecamp's open-source projects in collaboration
      with the community,
    </li>
    <li>
      contributing my unique perspective as a trained designer and problem
      solver, as well as a developer,
    </li>
    <li>
      working closely with and learning from Sam and Javan, as well as the other
      team members and departments,
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>and maybe even refreshing my Ruby!</strong>
    </li>
  </ul>
